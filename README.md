# Speed Control Using PWM (Arduino)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates controlling the speed of DC motors using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** with Arduino.  
It also integrates ultrasonic sensor input and LEDs for distance-based speed control.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO / ESP32
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- LEDs (Red, Green, Blue)
- Power Supply

## 🛠️ Features
- Motor speed dynamically adjusts based on obstacle distance
- Red LED → Car stopped  
- Blue LED → Obstacle detected nearby  
- Green LED → Car moving normally
